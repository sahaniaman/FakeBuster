# FakeBuster Extension Icons

## Required Icon Files

Place the following icon files in this directory:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (for browser UI)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (for browser UI)  
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (for extension management)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (for Chrome Web Store)

## Icon Design Guidelines

- Use a shield or security-themed design
- Colors: Blue (#007bff) and white for trust
- Include "FB" or shield symbol
- Ensure visibility at small sizes

## Temporary Solution

For development, you can:
1. Use any PNG files with the correct names
2. Create simple colored squares as placeholders
3. Use online icon generators
4. Design custom icons later

## Creating Simple Icons

You can create basic colored PNG files:
- Create 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 128x128 pixel images
- Use blue background with white "FB" text
- Save as PNG format

The extension will work without icons, but Chrome will show warnings.
